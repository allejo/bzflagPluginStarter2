Welcome to version 2.0 of a project no one asked for, BZFlag Plug-in Starter. I have been wanting to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), so I decided that I would overhaul [version 1](https://github.com/allejo/bzflagPluginStarter) of the project to be entirely JavaScript based.
